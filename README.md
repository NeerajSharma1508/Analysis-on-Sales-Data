The analysis covers: <br>
1. Total transactions count by gender <br>
2. Gender-wise distribution <br>
3. Gender-wise total sales amount <br>
4. Age group-wise transactions count <br>
5. Age group-wise total sales amount <br>
6. Top 5 states by total quantity ordered <br>
7. Top 5 states by total sales amount <br>

9. Amount-wise product category analysis <br>
10. Product category & gender-wise transactions count <br>
11. Profession-wise transactions count <br>
12. Amount-wise top professions <br>
13. Top 10 products by total quantity ordered <br>

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used <br>
• Python 🐍<br>
• Pandas – Data manipulation<br>
• NumPy – Numerical computing<br>
• Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization<br>

## 📂 Dataset Information<br>
• Rows: 11,257<br>
• Columns: 13 → After cleaning → 12<br>
• Key Features:<br>
    • User_ID, Customer Name, Product_ID, Age, Age Group, Gender, State, Zone, Profession, Product_Category, Orders, Amount<br>

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps<br>
1. Removed unnecessary column (Zipcode)<br>
2. Dropped missing values<br>
3. Standardized gender representation (M → Male)<br>
4. Verified data types and consistency<br>

📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)<br>
• Gender Distribution: Female customers dominate with ~70% of transactions<br>
• Sales by Gender: Females contribute higher total sales compared to males<br>
• Age Group: 26–35 years age group has the maximum transactions & purchase volume<br>
• Top States: Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka lead in orders & revenue<br>
• Product Categories: Beauty, Sports, and Electronics are among top-performing categories<br>
• Professions: IT, Healthcare, and Aviation professionals show higher spending<br>
• Top Products: Identified top 10 products by orders<br>

## 📝 Conclusion<br>
1. Female customers aged 26–35 years, from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, working in IT, Healthcare, and Aviation, are the most likely to purchase.<br>
2. Beauty, Sports, and Electronics are the most popular categories.<br>
3. These insights can help businesses target their marketing strategies and optimize inventory management.<br>
